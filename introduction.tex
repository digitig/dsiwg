\section{Introduction (Informative)} \label{bkm:introduction}

\dsiwgSectionQuote{We're entering a new world in which data may be more important than software.}{Tim O'Reilly}

\subsection{Aim and Scope}
This guidance document aims to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe the data safety problem;
	\item Provide methods for identifying and analysing levels of risk; and
	\item Recommend methods and approaches for evaluating and treating those risks.
\end{itemize}

This document has been written for a wide readership. Its target audience covers all those who have an interest in, or a responsibility for, safety-related data within systems, including: Managers, Developers, Safety Engineers, Assurers (including Independent Safety Auditors), Regulators and Operators. 

The breadth of readership is also intended to cover a number of different sectors. As such, the document identifies a wide spectrum of safety-related data that exists in many forms within systems, from specification and requirements data, to maintenance and disposal data, and everything in between. In particular, this document is not just concerned with numerical or well-structured data used during system operation.

It should be noted that, while they are considered mature enough to be useful, the contents of the document represent current thoughts on what is a complex and evolving area. Furthermore, to allow it to be produced within a reasonable timescale, this edition focuses on key items; it is not intended to be exhaustive. For example, this guidance document does not consider issues relating to staff competence or organizational structure.

\subsection{Intended Relationship to Other Documents}
This document is intended to be used as a supplement to existing standards and norms that are relevant to the scope of the engineering work being undertaken. In such cases it may be used to provide a deeper insight into the risks that data poses to the project team's outputs, allowing them to produce credible improvements to the safety argument as a result. Where a standard or norm sets out specific data-related objectives then, unless agreed otherwise with the regulator or safety duty holder, they shall take precedence over the guidance provided herein.

In the longer-term the hope is that future standards and norms will take up relevant concepts, approaches and methods from those described within this document. It is also hoped that organizations will include the concepts, approaches and methods in their own safety management processes.

\subsection{Normative, Informative and Discursive Text}
Three types of text are used within this guidance document:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \dsiwgTextBF{Normative} text, which is prescriptive. Typically, this text is restricted to describing objectives and outputs.
	\item \dsiwgTextBF{Informative} text, which is descriptive text that is closely linked to the normative text. Typically, this text provides a suggested way by which compliance with the normative text may be achieved. Note, however, that alternative means of compliance are possible.
	\item \dsiwgTextBF{Discursive} text, which contains discussions that are relevant to the general topic of Data Safety, but which are not closely linked to the normative text. A discussion on the relationship between data and software is an example of such text; descriptions of historical incidents and accidents are another.
\end{itemize}

Each section (or appendix) of this guidance document contains a single text type. The relevant type is indicated in the section (or appendix) title.

\subsection{Compliance}
There may be occasions when it is desirable, or necessary, to make a claim of compliance against the objectives listed in this document. Such a claim may be required, for example, if this document is explicitly included as a normative reference from a formal standard. Alternatively, it may be required as part of an organization's internal processes.

To facilitate compliance claims, the following terminology is used within the normative parts of this guidance document:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \dsiwgTextBF{SHALL} denotes items where evidence of compliance must be provided in order to claim compliance with this guidance document.
	\item \dsiwgTextBF{SHOULD} denotes items where, in some circumstances, there may be valid reasons for not complying with a particular item. The full implications of non-compliance must be understood, documented and approved in order to claim compliance with this guidance document.
	\item \dsiwgTextBF{MAY} denotes items that are optional. These may be advantageous in some circumstances but not in others. Organizations are free to adopt any approach to these items without the need for further justification.
\end{itemize}
