\section{Feedback (Discursive)} \label{bkm:feedback}

\dsiwgSectionQuote{I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better.}{Elon Musk}

Comments from users of the Guidance document are always welcome.
\todo{This section to be omitted from published document}
This section records feedback received and the actions we have taken as a result.

Fully completed entries have been ``greyed out''. Green background has been used for comments addressed in the current update.
Those that are not yet fully addressed retain a white background.

2&The Organisational Data Risk Assessment does not fit well into the overall DSAL-based approach.

Section 6.3.1, para following first table: Explains that it's the *lowest* likelihood which should be used in selecting the overall DSAL. This is very unusual, and needs to be expanded upon.

4&Section 6.4.2.2: The use of the tables in 6.4.2.3 to 6.4.2.10 is not explained and currently has to be worked out from the later "worked example". An explanation of how to use the tables in sections 6.4.2.3 to 6.4.2.10 is needed, to explain how they should be applied, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The pattern matching,
        \item The meaning of the "dots",
        \item Why we keep the dots.
    \end{itemize}&A step-by-step guide has been added to 6.4.2.2 which addresses each of these issues.\\

  %
  5&Section 5.3.2.1 includes a DSAL table. However the table does not make sense at this point in the document, as the definition of each likelihood category is not given until page 28, twelve pages later. Need to bring definitions forward, create a reference, or move both table and definitions into the earlier section on the DSMP.&New paragraph added under table as a short-term fix. **Long term fix requires reordering of the document**\\\hline
  %
  \rowcolor{gray}
  6&Section 5.3.2.2: Para 2suggests that assurance levels may come "from perspectives other than data safety". The paragraph should end with a note to suggest that "Such mappings should be included within the DSMP".&Done, with the text ``Where such an approach is used, the mapping to \glspl{dsal} should be included within the \gls{dsmp}''.\\\hline

  10&Section 6.1.6 table: Items 10 and 12 appear to have significant overlap and caused some confusion. In the case of an aircraft system, is \#10 intended to cover configuration for an F16 aircraft, and \#12 for a specific F16, or does \#10 set up the general menus and \#12 configure menus specific to F16, C-17, etc? We were able to interpret \#11 as "to get it to do what you want", but considering real cases against \#10 and \#12 caused the confusion and made us realise that we were uncertain about the boundaries between all three.&Already described in Appendix E. Extra words added to 6.1.6.\\\hline

18&Section 6.4.2.2 table 2: This table of "data properties" is the same as the list of Data Properties presented in section 6.2.3. If we must list them twice, at least cross reference the two tables, so that the reader of section 6.4.2.2 does not wonder how these also magically appear. It might actually be better to embed the Abbreviations in the earlier table, to avoid the need for this one along with cross-referencing.&Cross reference added. **Long term fix: merge tables**\\\hline
19&Section 6.4.2.2 bulleted list following table 2: Why do we have a new set of headings, instead of the list of data type "headings" within the table of section 6.1.6? There appears to be no good reason for introducing a new list and we probably need to harmonise the two lists.&**TBD**\\\hline
20&Section 6.4.2.4: Title is "Data Design" yet only the first four entries fit this title. A better name may be "Construction of the data storage structures and methods".&Inserted descriptive text. **Long term fix: retitle**\\\hline

23&Section 6.4.2.6 and 6.4.2.7 both include "Client sign-off" however there is no indication of how this maintains a property of the data.&**TBD**\\\hline
24&Section 6.4.2.7: "Client sign-Off of Data": How can the client determine that the data is "appropriate"?&**TBD**\\\hline

34&Section 7.5: It would be helpful to state where each table comes from: "System Design, pages 34-35...Data Design, pages 36-37..." Otherwise the section is hard to read, and the empty tables do not make sense.&Added links in header of each table\\\hline
%
\rowcolor{gray}
35&Section 7.5, table 3: I note that Data Quality Trend Analysis has been excluded (as it was a "-" for DSAL 1, not an "R") yet appears to be a particularly relevant technique. This suggests that in the explanation of how to use the tables, we need to suggest that even when a "-" appearing against a given DSAL would be grounds for exclusion, it is worth considering whether domain-specific factors could make the approach worth considering.&Incorporated into the step-by-step explanation of how to use the Technique tables.\\\hline
%
\rowcolor{gray}
36&Section 7.5, table 8 (MEx): Why has "Multiple copies" been excluded?&No action: It's DSAL 1, so not needed.\\\hline
%
37&Section 7.5, final table: Claims "There is no contracted client..."yet earlier we're told about how involved the Health Organisation has been - clearly a prospective client "who are procuring a solution". For each of DD4, TD5 and TD6 there are aspects which should be resolved with the client. What does client sign-off mean? Is it an acceptable approach? If not, do additional techniques need to be applied?&**TBD**\\\hline

  1&DSG v3.0 reveals that “checklist” only features in the stories reported in Appendix H. We should add it as a technique, possibly in section 6.4.2.7 “Data Checking”.&New row added to \autoref{tab:MethodsDataChecking}\\\hline

  2&It’s been pointed out to me that the detailed table of “Hazop Guidewords” in appendix F of DSG v3 conflates “Hazop data considerations” with “Hazop data guidewords”. The reality is that the contents of the column “Hazop data considerations” are the HAZOP guidewords and the contents of the column “Hazop data guidewords” are the sub-property “considerations” (or meta properties) of the data property in the “Property” column.

  Taking the first row in the table as an example: The data property of “integrity” can be considered for “correctness” by asking the HAZOP questions of what the impact of loss of data, partial loss of data, incorrect data, and multiple data might have on this property (given the context and situation of the questions framing).&It's \autoref{tab:HazopShort} which was wrong -- the guidewords were labelled as considerations. I've re-titled the column header in that table. Also added text prior to the table and at the head of \autoref{bkm:guidewords}.\\\hline

  When Distribution was added to \autoref{tab:issues}, Oscar pointed out that
  Data Distribution faces two main challenges: 1) Integration and 2) Communication.
  Communication is always a risk to data loss, network problems, hackers.
  The current text for ``Distribution'' addresses the first.
  Mark Templeton sees this as part of a more general weakness in the document,
  that it is primarily concerned with data as an object -
  we really need to review the document to ensure that free-flowing data gets addressed.

  DSIWG meeting \#62 minutes, section 3:
  There was further discussion on the issue raised by MT around the possibility of a missing HAZOP
  guide word related to “Sufficiency”.
  
  For the Hazop we may need guidewords such as “Spurious”, “Erroneous”, “Incorrect timing” or
  “Unwanted duplication”.
  
  The problem could be termed “Spuriousity” or “Spuriousness” or “Unexpected” or “Unsolicited”. In
  the end “Unexpected” is probably the best phrasing.
  
  MP suggested that there may be parallels with ‘Dark Data’ which need to be explored.
  
  Action 62.2 (MP): Consider a ‘Dark Data’ type of treatment for unwanted or unexpected data
  
  It was thought that a new guidance section on messaging issues may be required, including aspects
  such as timing, noise, masking, CRC defeat. There are really two aspects: delivery of the unexpected
  message itself and then unexpected payload within the message.
  
  Note that we can also get issues with continuous data feeds. A fundamental issue is the breaking the
  ‘contract’ between sender and receiver (as often documented in Interface Control Documents).
  
  It was also noted that some of the existing property definitions probably need a refresh.&
  Issue 3.4 of the Guidance introduced the Goldilocks property, and the new guide word ``insufficient''.

  **TBD** The Guidance remains weak on communications issues, and we should consider this a candidate for future enhancements, possibly through an appendix focussed on communication / data transfer issues. Deferred to 4.0\\\hline

    {\color{red} [Missing history, key issue of data safety, how it looks when safety achieved]}
  \item Scope: improve description (to what and where it applies and where it doesn't apply) {\color{red} [Exclusions, tighter description, rationale (esp. for management), benefits to programmes]}
  \item Tailoring/references with other standards
  \item Objectives: don't combine it with outputs (they should end up in a list of work products) {\color{red} [Need to have a more obvious safety argument structure supported by evidence (work products – all WP need unique refs.); need better cross-references]}
  \item Input list/section [What is needed to begin, what are expected outcomes]
    {\color{red} [Note: current guidance missing various distinctions of types of dynamic data, e.g. transmitted vs. stored data.]}
  \item Requirements for compliance (objectives are formulated like this already, the DSAL list with "notes" could be reformulated to cover this approach) 
  \item Implementation guidance (for requirements, like description with examples)
  \item List/section of work products (evidence of achievement)
