\dsiwgSectionQuote{I wanted to separate data from programs, because data and instructions are very different.}{Ken Thompson}


\subsection{Establish Context}
\subsubsection{Interface control}\index{Interface!Organizational}
The interfaces between \index{Data!Owner}\glspl{data owner}, and indeed data ownership itself, can be much more complicated\cbstart\ for data\cbend\ than for hardware or software, where the owner can be clearly identified. Indeed, when combining items from various sources it is possible to create data for which there is not an ``owner'' in any traditional sense. In such circumstances it may be appropriate for the overall system owner to take responsibility for the collected data and, where appropriate, pass specific, formally-recorded requirements \cbstart on to\cbend\ original data suppliers. 

The \cbstart \index{Data!Owner}\glspl{data owner} or lack of data owner throughout the lifecycle\index{Lifecycle!Data} of data within the system should be identified\cbend, including where data is merged or modified through the system operation. This will \cbstart help gain a greater understanding of how data safety issues can be controlled \cbend within the assessment at a particular organizational level.

\subsubsection{\ecapitalisewords{\glsentrylong{odr}} Form}
\cbstart\autoref{bkm:assessment} presents an \gls{odr} assessment form capture a high-level perspective on the risk posed to an organization by data safety issues within a specific project. How the assessment integrates with an organization's existing risk (or safety) management processes is the responsibility of the implementing organization. Ihe form could be used to help tailor the data safety process. The following paragraphs describe the connections between the \gls{odr} and the
\acrshort{iso} 31000 \cite{citation:iso310002018risk}
standard for risk management\cbend.

Establishing the context of a risk assessment ensures that the system being considered and the scope of any assessment is well defined. This helps prevent an overrun of the assessment's boundaries and allows \cbstart which items are in or out of scope\cbend\ to be explicitly communicated to all \index{Stakeholder}\glspl{stakeholder}. In addition, it is the role of this activity to \cbstart determine\cbend\ the criteria that a system will be judged on. The \gls{odr} assessment links directly to the sub-tasks identified by \acrshort{iso} 31000 for establishing the risk assessment context and introduces aspects to guide the assessor \cbstart in assessing\cbend\  data-specific risks.

Questions 2, 3 and 4 of the \gls{odr} align directly with\cbstart\ activity 6.3.3 from \acrshort{iso} 31000: establishing the external context of the risk assessment.
They guide the assessor in assessing\cbend\ the risk appetite of external \index{Stakeholder}\glspl{stakeholder}, the level of risk that is allocated to the organization, and the regulatory environment within the project will operate.

Question 5 \cbstart establishes the internal context of the risk assessment (Activity 6.3.3 from \acrshort{iso} 31000),
helping the assessor determine the maturity of the organization in terms of their attitude to risk and specifically to data-driven risks\cbend.

Question 6 explores \index{Data!Owner}data ownership through the use cases of the system. This is related to the legal frameworks explored in question 4, but also acts to lay the foundations of activity 6.3.4 \cbstart from \acrshort{iso} 31000\cbend,
defining risk criteria, which requires an assessor to identify ``the nature and types of causes and consequences that can occur and how they will be measured''. \cbstart Questions 1, 7 and 8 expand on this, considering data-driven specifics of\cbend\ failure consequences and the issues raised by data complexity, boundary complexity, and system complexity for the project.

Finally, the scoring system of the \gls{odr} provides a heuristic for defining the risk criteria
(Activity 6.3.4 \cbstart from \acrshort{iso} 31000\cbend)
which \cbstart determines\cbend\ how to combine these different aspects of risk into a single, high-level estimate of the data-related risks associated with a given project. This means that the \gls{odr} can, for example, provide some guidance on data safety assurance principle ``4 + 1''; that is, it provides some guidance on the amount of effort that should be directed towards the management of data safety issues.
 
\cbstart While\cbend\ the completion of an \gls{odr} fits within the context establishment activity, it also augments the ongoing communication and consultation activity both by providing a standardised format for capturing the relevant \gls{information} and securing endorsement.

\subsubsection{Data Safety Culture Questionnaire}
\cbstart The \gls{odr} assessment includes\cbend\ assessing the organization's maturity in managing data safety risks; \cbstart the questions\cbend\ are aimed at establishing the depth of awareness of data safety and the associated management processes within the organization. However, measuring the level of awareness of processes and concepts in an organization is not always easy. There may be sufficient high-level knowledge of this for the purposes of the \gls{odr}, but it still may be an area that warrants further investigation.

To support this, \cbstart\autoref{bkm:culture} includes a separate data safety culture questionnaire to explore the specific area of measuring the data safety culture for a particular activity, whether this be for the organization as a whole or for a particular project, service, or activity. Here the focus is on a personal view rather than a project or company view, so the questionnaire would be completed by all or a significant subset of staff. \index{Response}\Glspl{response} can be aggregated to give an overall data safety culture value. This approach can be periodically repeated to determine trends. For example, if overall scores are declining this may suggest that further training and briefings will be required.\cbend\

\subsubsection{System Definition}
The system under consideration should be understood and documented, including interfaces\index{Interface!System} and safety-related data aspects. The process of documenting the system of interest furthers the understanding of \index{Stakeholder}\glspl{stakeholder} and approvers so they can make sensible judgements about the system. It also formally declares assumptions that are being made\cbstart\ in the system assessment\cbend\ and clearly defines the limits of the assessment. In addition, different levels of risk may be associated with composites of safety-related data, which may be easier to manage than individual \index{Artefact, Data}\cbstart\glspl{data artefact}\cbend, or where independence cannot be demonstrated or maintained. Hence, the partitioning of \glspl{dataset} should also be considered during this phase.

\subsubsection{Supplier Data Maturity}
As \cbstart already noted, some usage scenarios involve data being supplied by subcontracted organizations. Some formal process will typically be used to select these suppliers. \autoref{bkm:maturity} includes a questionnaire to help ensure that the supplier has suitable processes in place to manage data safety-related issues.\cbend.

\subsubsection{Data Categories\index{Category!Data|textbf}}
\label{bkm:datacategories}
The full set of data categories which can have safety implications is large: to date more than twenty categories (and one meta-category) have been identified. 

\cbstart\autoref{tab:CategoriesShort} gives the current view of the categories of safety-related data that contribute to, are used by, produced by, or affected by safety-related systems. They are roughly organized into a number of categories\index{Category!Data}, which aim to cover all aspects of the system lifecycle\index{Lifecycle!System}. The list in \autoref{tab:CategoriesShort} is not exhaustive. A more detailed version of this table is given in \autoref{bkm:categories}.\cbend\

\subsection{Identify Risks}
\subsubsection{Historical Accidents and Incidents}
Ideally, data safety risks would be identified and mitigated before they led to an accident or incident. However, this is not always the case. Historical occurrences can provide an indication of the data safety risks present in planned or existing systems. In particular, accidents and incidents can be analysed to identify potential contributory causes relating to data.

To support this type of analysis a number of previous accidents and incidents have been collected in \autoref{bkm:accidents}.
These include cases which relate to a number of \glspl{data property} (see
\hyperref[bkm:guidance:dataproperties]{section}~\ref{bkm:guidance:dataproperties}), %Clunky, but \autoref inserted "subsubsection"
for example the properties of \index{Completeness!Property}\gls{completeness}, \index{Integrity Property}\gls{integrity} and \gls{timeliness}\index{Timeliness Property}.
They also highlight the importance of the \gls{adaptation data}\index{Adaptation Data} category\index{Category!Data} and dangers associated with the inappropriate use of default data values.

Most of the current collection of accidents and incidents fall into three categories: aviation, maritime, and medical. However, the lessons that can be learned span a much wider range of application areas.

\subsubsection{Ways that Data Can Cause Problems}
\label{tab:issues}
There are some risk-inducing issues that are different or more prevalent for data than for other system elements. An incomplete collection of examples is provided below. This list may provide a quick way of identifying risks, which could be especially useful at an early stage of a project:

\begin{description}
\item[Fluidity:] Hardware and software can undergo significant amounts of product assurance and once assured may change relatively infrequently. Where change is required to hardware or software, it can be carefully managed and the impact on the safety case appraised. This is not always the case for data, which is often much more fluid. Indeed the ease with which data can be changed is one motivation for the move towards \glspl{data-driven system}. This fluidity means that it is not always possible to revisit safety cases when data changes. For example, the safety case for an autonomous vehicle cannot be updated every time that the vehicle acquires new knowledge during operation. Instead, the fact that data can change, along with any associated safety impacts, may need to be captured in the system safety case. Fluidity can also provide a temptation for unscrupulous operators to falsify data, for example, after an incident has occurred. Rigorous configuration control procedures can help protect against this type of behaviour.

\item[Reuse:] For the purposes of this discussion, ``reuse'' is interpreted as use of the same data in a different system or system context (e.g., lifecycle\index{Lifecycle!System} phase). Just because data was valid for use in a particular system, it does not immediately follow that it can be reused again in a similar system. Many considerations associated with data reuse are similar to those of software reuse, for example, similarity of requirements, similarity of role in the system, and similarity of required \index{Integrity Property}\gls{integrity} / \index{Assurance Level}assurance level. One consideration that is different is that of \gls{timeliness}\index{Timeliness Property}: data that was valid for use in a particular system at a particular time is not necessarily valid for reuse in the same system at a different time.

\item[Ageing:] As highlighted above, all safety-related data has a lifetime and this needs to be explicitly managed. This can involve, for example, purging, deleting and alerting. \cbstart Ageing can occur as a result of changes external to the system (for example, records of the positions of other aircraft, newly discovered drug interactions, or new software patches), or it can result from internal changes (e.g., valves gradually becoming less responsive, \gls{configuration data} becoming out of date, or data schemas evolving over time).\cbend\

\item[Transformation:] Data is often filtered, mapped or aggregated as it moves through systems, sometimes creating new \glspl{dataset} as a result. \Glspl{data property} are not necessarily preserved by these processes. Sometimes data is filtered too much or only some of the data is selected (either deliberately or inadvertently through accident or unintended bias), such as by the selection of only the test runs that succeeded. The main issues are loss of heritage / history / source \gls{information}. Data can also appear to become something else. Without careful management, the \index{Integrity Property}\gls{integrity} may become lowered to the lowest common denominator and this needs to be recognized. Additional checks (e.g., \gls{validation} checks,\cbstart\ credibility\cbend\ checks) or assurance measures may \cbstart be needed\cbend\ to ensure that required \index{Integrity Property}\gls{integrity} / assurance is maintained.

\item[Archiving and retrieval:] Safety-related data needs to be available when required. \cbstart Data \gls{accessibility}\index{Accessibility Property} needs to be considered\cbend over the complete system lifetime. It is also important to consider what \index{Property!Data}properties of the data need to be preserved and how this affects the choice of storage medium.

\item[Biasing:] This is a systemic \index{Accuracy Property}inaccuracy in data due to the characteristics of the process employed in the creation, collection, manipulation, presentation, and interpretation of data. It is usually an unintentional distortion in the \gls{dataset}. One example of this is the confirmation bias that may be applied to safety claims, and another example is that synthetic autonomous vehicle training \glspl{database} can have issues with artificial data if it is not realistic.
Although there is no perfect way of checking for this within the system, \index{Completeness!Checks}\gls{completeness}, statistical and validity checks on \glspl{dataset} may help.

\item[Falsification / misinformation:] This issue arises where data is created, modified, or deleted either accidentally or deliberately so as to mislead or misinform potential consumers of that data. Examples from policing and criminal justice might \cbstart include notes being taken with fabricated times or dates or a crime from the wrong individual in a \gls{database} being accidentally added or removed\cbend. Another example might be a supplier falsifying quality records for materials or goods. There have been many cases of misinformation related to the Covid-19\index{Covid-19} pandemic (for example on social media) where people have been deliberately misled, and sometimes this has led to harm (\cbstart for example, bleach being drunk as a cure\cbend). \cbstart Possible \glspl{mitigation}\index{Mitigation}\cbend\ include digitally signing transmitted data, strong access controls, independent fact-checking, and audit records.

item[Defaulting:] Many systems use default or initial values for \glspl{item data}; sometimes in \glspl{dataset} and sometimes embedded in software. Often these default values are designed to be neutral (e.g., ``0'') or unrealistic (e.g., ``VOID''). There are essentially two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item initialisation data which may persist and be mistakenly taken as a real value when in fact it should have been changed; and
	\item data that is used when no meaningful value has been assigned (e.g., during data migration or data exchange between systems).
\end{enumerate}	
These issues can often be managed through good design of data structures, for example by the inclusion of a validity flag.

\item[Sentinels:] A sentinel value is a data value that is used to indicate a special action needs to be taken, typically indicating the end of a record or a \gls{dataset}. The sentinel value should be one that is not allowable in the \gls{dataset} itself, but often is not properly considered and may use common sequences (e.g., five zeroes). Sentinels can cause problems in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item where they are not recognized and so, for example, processing \cbstart includes or continues\cbend\ past the sentinel; and
	\item where the data itself somehow contains the sentinel value and so processing is erroneously interrupted.
\end{enumerate}
Sentinels can be a particular risk in long-lived systems and \glspl{dataset}. As with \cbstart defaulting\cbend, the management or elimination of this issue may often be achieved through improved data structures.

\item[Aliasing:] This is an effect that causes different data to become indistinguishable when accessed; that is, there is only one record when there should be several -- for example, two patients with similar names inadvertently sharing a single set of medical records. This could be due to the way the data is filtered, sampled, indexed, stored, or retrieved. The data issues are typically related to loss of resolution leading to similar data points appearing to be identical. \cbstart Methods to maintain resolution, including use of unique indexes, may be beneficial.\cbend\

One specific case of aliasing \cbstart\ concerns \cbend homophones -- words which sound the same but are different such as ``flower'' / ``flour'' and ``bare'' / ``bear'' \cite{citation:homonym}.
If these words are read out over a phone there may be confusion as to which is intended.
Location services based on a number of words such as W3W don't avoid all homophones,
and so there may be issues when the words are given verbally in an emergency. The issue is discussed further in \autoref{bkm:incacc:w3w}.

\item[Disassociation:] This effect is, in some senses, the opposite of aliasing: there are several records when there should only be one. This could occur, for example, if two records are created for the same individual using slightly different names. It could also arise if different systems use different indexing methods and the association between the indexes becomes corrupted. Again, methods to maintain data resolution can be beneficial.

\item[Masking:] This issue can arise if a notable proportion of a \gls{dataset} is of a poor \cbstart\gls{quality}\cbend, for example, if sensors producing the data are faulty or measurements are taken from the wrong source. This poor quality data can mask errors in the way that the system handles the good quality data. One way of protecting against this issue is the generation and use of test sets of appropriate size and quality, although for some applications this may be a non-trivial task.

\item[Incompleteness:]\index{Completeness!Property} Not all the data that is needed is always available; there may be known, and sometimes, unknown gaps or missing data points. The missing data points ("dark data"\index{Dark Data} -- see \autoref{bkm:darkdata}) can be critical and in some cases, more important than the data that is available. Incomplete data can arise, for example, from limitations on how much data can be physically captured (eg.~sampling frequencies, storage / time constraints) or from the unintentional or deliberate darkening of data (eg.~for privacy, security, political or commercial reasons).

item[Volume:] Data can be so large and unstructured that it is not manageable in practicable timeframes.
For example, video records of rail track could take days to inspect manually.

\item[Interpretation:] Data can be misinterpreted -- too much or too little deduced from available data, or data extrapolated incorrectly to derive unsound results.
An example is \gls{ml} data\index{Machine Learning Data}, especially real or recorded data that may not contain critical edge / corner cases.

\item[Distribution:] Data can be decentralised, decomposed or distributed across many sources (e.g. channels, \glspl{database}, websites) and needs to be consistently integrated to make a coherent picture. In the health sector\cbstart\ many IT systems often \cbend have to work together feeding in different parts of a patient medical record to make a complete health picture. If parts of this distributed data are missing (for instance diagnostic test results) then it is difficult if not impossible to obtain the complete picture, and mistakes may be made.
There are several parts to this problem:
\begin{description}
	\item[Integration] -- multiple elements of data have to be brought together in a coherent way, addressing aspects such as which data should supercede or replace other data;
	\item[Communication] -- having correct and current \gls{information} about what data is available and its location so it can be requested; and
	\item[Contingency:] -- what to to if part of the distributed data is unavailable or late.
\end{description}
\end{description}


Further examples of how data may cause issues in many scenarios is given in \cbstart the book \dsiwgTextIT{Data-Centric Safety: Challenges, Approaches, and Incident Investigation} \cite{citation:datacentric}\cbend.

\subsubsection{\ecapitalisewords{\glsentryplural{data property}}}\label{bkm:guidance:dataproperties}
\Glspl{data property} are used to establish what aspects of the data (e.g., \gls{timeliness}\index{Timeliness Property}, \gls{accuracy}\index{Accuracy Property}) need to be guaranteed in order that the system operates in a safe manner.

James Inge's work \cite{citation:inge2008improving} produced a useful taxonomy of data categories, and went on to look at faults in data. He concluded that a rigid taxonomy of data categories was unhelpful due to various properties or characteristics of the data which vary independently. In short, it is the combination of data category\index{Category!Data} with the required \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property} that facilitates safety analysis.

Data categories were discussed in the preceding phase. \cbstart\autoref{tab:PropertiesOfData} documents a non-exhaustive collection of \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property}. Typically, it is the loss of one of these \glspl{data property} that presents a \gls{hazard}. This notion of ``loss'' is dependent on the intended use; for example, what is ``timely'' for one use may not be for another.\cbend\

The ``\Gls{goldilocks}'' property \cbstart addresses\cbend\ appropriate sizing and quantity of data. A number of issues have been found to arise when there is too much or too little data. While it is particularly relevant to communications links, it may have relevance to other areas such as \glspl{database} and when people are involved in reviewing or checking data. The property is named ``\gls{goldilocks}'' as it refers to the need to have not too much, not too little, but just the right amount of data%
%
\footnote{A system where the property was lost involved a high speed \cbstart data\cbend\ bus that connected several safety-critical systems. A transceiver of that bus failed and transmitted random noise. The receivers employed parity checks and cyclic redundancy check, but the system had been designed to eliminate occasional \cbstart\glspl{error}\cbend. When random noise filled the bus, several apparently valid messages were created every second, resulting in potentially lethal behaviour.

In a \gls{hazop}\index{HAZOP} carried out during 2020, based upon the \gls{hazop}\index{HAZOP} guidewords \cbstart in this guidance\cbend, the facilitator realised that certain failure modes had not been identified by the \gls{hazop} team. In addition to the issue of system overload already discussed, those omissions also concerned system behaviour following data rejection. In these cases, bad data was detected and rejected, but the consequences of data rejection over an extended period had not been considered.}.

The \gls{goldilocks}\index{Goldilocks Property} property is related to the \cbstart data volume problem \cbend\ discussed in \hyperref[tab:issues]{section}~\ref{tab:issues}, however, given the importance of data sizing and the experience of real-world incidents this is now a separate property.

%
\paragraph{The \glsfmttext{analysability}\index{Analysability Property|textbf} property}\label{bkm:guidance:analysability}
The \gls{analysability} property \cbstart recognizes\cbend\ that data is now \cbstart\ highly complex and extensive, often large scale, and distributed. And yet, for safety purposes we need to make sure it is of suitable quality and able to support system goals.\cbend\
We therefore need to ensure that it is possible to analyse it for key characteristics and \cbstart establish meaningful results using tools or other means.\cbend\ This property is related to explainabilty and may be performed by the same set of tools or techniques.

\paragraph{The \glsfmttext{explainability}\index{Explainability Property|textbf} property}\label{bkm:guidance:explainability}
\Gls{explainability} \cbstart describes the ability to establish what the purpose and effect data (and especially changes to data) has on a system
and explain this to relevant \glspl{stakeholder} in terms that they can understand. It is particularly important for learning and AI-based systems.\cbend\
This could be, for example, \gls{ml} training data or system \gls{configuration data}.
This property is related to \gls{analysability}\index{Analysability Property} and may be performed by the same set of tools or techniques.

\subsubsection{\glsfmtshort{hazop} Guidewords}\index{HAZOP}
\label{bkm:HazopGuidewords}
A \gls{hazop} \cite{citation:iec61882:2016}
provides a structured approach for identifying hazards. It involves a multidisciplinary team collaborating to identify potential hazards and operability problems. Structure and \index{Completeness!Hazard Identification}\gls{completeness} are supported through the use of guideword prompts, for example, considering the implications if software components perform functions early, late or not at all. These prompts are intended to stimulate imaginative thinking, to focus the study and to elicit ideas and discussion.

\autoref{tab:HazopShort}\index{HAZOP} lists a set of guidewords for a data-focused \gls{hazop}, based upon the \index{Property!Data}properties defined in \autoref{tab:PropertiesOfData}. The intent here is to assess the impact of each guideword on the property under consideration. For example, the first row considers \dsiwgTextIT{loss} of \index{Integrity Property}\gls{integrity}, \dsiwgTextIT{partial loss} of \index{Integrity Property}\gls{integrity}, and so on.
The list is non-exhaustive. Other guidewords may be useful for particular systems, or may be used to ensure the data safety assessment is fully integrated within the system safety assessment\index{Safety Assessment!System}\index{System Safety Assessment|see{Safety Assessment, System}}. \cbstart A\cbend\ more detailed version of this table, including specific \gls{hazop}\index{HAZOP} data considerations, is available at \autoref{bkm:guidewords}.

\subsection{Analyse Risks}
\subsubsection{Establishing \glsfmtplural{dsal}}\index{Assurance Level!Data}
\label{bkm:Establishing-DSALS}
\hyperref[bkm:DSAL-table-section]{Section}~\ref{bkm:DSAL-table-section} %Clunky, but \autoref inserted "paragraph"
presented a method for \cbstart assigning\cbend \gls{dsal}s, by combining severity and likelihood through a risk matrix, such as \autoref{tab:DSAL-risk-matrix}. This section describes approaches that may be used to determine the severity and likelihood appropriate to the loss of any given \index{Property!Data}property. In principle, \autoref {tab:Likelihood} and \autoref{tab:Severity} are used together with \autoref{tab:DSAL-risk-matrix} to determine a \gls{dsal}. However, \cbstart\ the methods to determine severity and likelihood, and to combine them to determine a \gls{dsal}, should not be followed rigidly, but should be defined based upon the overall \index{Safety Requirement!System}safety requirements of the system being assessed. Examples of situations that may require such alternate approaches are described in
\hyperref[bkm:activities:analyse:partofsystemsafetyactivities]{section}~\ref{bkm:activities:analyse:partofsystemsafetyactivities}, %Clunky, again avoidging "paragraph"
while potential approaches to customisation are described in \autoref{bkm:DsalCustomisation}.
It is essential that any customised approach is recorded in the \gls{dsmp}\cbend.

The likelihood of a data safety related risk is qualitatively determined by
consideration of the significance of a \gls{error}, along with the defences currently in place against such errors. These factors may be addressed by
considering the following characteristics:

\begin{description}
  \item[Proximity:] how directly a data failure will lead to an accident;
  \item[Dependency:] how dependent the application is on the \gls{dataset};
  \item[Preventability:] the ability of the systems architect / developers to guard against \cbstart\glspl{error}\cbend;
  \item[Detectability:] the likelihood of being able to detect a data failure prior to an accident; and
  \item[Correctability:] the ability of the system to work around or correct \cbstart\glspl{error}\cbend.
\end{description}

For example, errors that are easy to guard against are associated with low likelihoods. Conversely, errors that are difficult to detect are associated with high likelihoods. \autoref {tab:Likelihood} illustrates how aspects of these characteristics map to three, qualitative likelihoods.  \cbstart\ The table assumes the actions implied are taken. For example, a low likelihood for the ``prevention'' characteristic is only valid if the easy guard / barrier is actually implemented. Similarly, it is assumed that if an error is found, under the ``detection'' characteristic, an appropriate \index{Response}\gls{response} is implemented.\cbend\

\end{longtable}

\cbstart Consideration of different characteristics is likely to result in different likelihoods. The overall \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} is that 
associated with the lowest likelihood of any characteristic. Taking the lowest likelihood, not the highest, might  seem non-intuitive. However, in doing so, it is important to only apply those rows of the table which are valid for the issue under consideration. For example, if it would be easy to implement a guard against a given error, but that guard is not actually in place, it would not be valid to claim that the likelihood is low based on the prevention row. In theory it should always be possible to determine likelihood based upon proximity and dependency. However, the benefits of prevention, detection and correction will not always be present.\cbend\

Risk severity is estimated against a five-point scale, as indicated in \autoref{tab:Severity}.

As noted earlier, \glspl{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} have some commonality with things like \cbstart\glspl{idal} and \glspl{fdal})\cbend. However, this commonality does not extend across all aspects. For example, there is an accepted calculus of \glspl{fdal} in which two independent \index{Integrity Property}lower-\gls{integrity} functions can be used to replace a single \index{Integrity Property}higher-\gls{integrity} function. There are two reasons why this type of calculus is not appropriate for \glspl{dsal}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The definition of a \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} already caters for interactions. For example, using two independent \index{Artefact, Data}\glspl{data artefact} to provide similar \gls{information} to a system function reduces the ``dependency'' of each artefact.
  \item These types of consideration are most closely related to system architecture, from which \index{Artefact, Data}\glspl{data artefact}, associated \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property} and risks are derived. Hence, rather than applying any calculus at the \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} tier it is more appropriate to apply this to, for example, \glspl{fdal}, with \glspl{dsal} changing as a consequence of the revised system definition.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Analysing \glsfmtplural{dsal}}\index{Assurance Level!Data}
When considering the possibility of data affecting software or software affecting data, the degree of contribution and existing \gls{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} position are important. The \glspl{mitigation} should be proportionate and full credit for existing \glspl{mitigation} may reduce or \cbstart remove\cbend\ the need for additional work. A particular case is the use of strong checksums to ``wrap'' the data. If these are preserved through processing and can be checked later on, then undetected  corruption \cbstart can\cbend\ be largely discounted.

\cbstart The with data affecting software is that the data used by the system might\cbend\ affect the software execution in a way that could credibly lead to \glspl{hazard}, but only where this data-induced effect is not easily detected or mitigated by other means. If this is the situation then appropriate measures need to be put in place \dsiwgTextIT{within the data} to mitigate this risk. Alternatively (or additionally), if the software within the system can be modified, \glspl{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} could be placed \dsiwgTextIT{within the software} to achieve or enhance the \gls{mitigation} needed:

\begin{description}
  \item[\Gls{mitigation} within the data:]\index{Mitigation} In many cases \cbstart\ this\cbend\ is the best or only option is to improve the quality of the data to avoid the issue. This can be done by introducing a \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} for the data, related to the severity of the \gls{hazard} which may be induced, and thereby addressing the issue at cause. In this case, the \gls{dsal} is bearing a large amount of responsibility. This may mean that a greater number of the ``recommended'' risk \index{Treatment!Risk}\gls{treatment} methods and approaches (identified in the following phase) need to be implemented.
  \item[\Gls{mitigation} within the software:] If the data cannot be assured to a \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} (e.g., if it is supplied by a third party or legacy system), sometimes changes can be made to the software in the system to improve the situation. These \glspl{mitigation} could be functional (e.g., introduction of better range checking, rejection of illegal combinations of data values). This requires not only specific software changes but also associated \gls{verification} of these new features, and any software changes will have to be implemented to an appropriate \index{Assurance Level!Software}\gls{software assurance level}. However there may be no particular functional \cbstart \glspl{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} that can be targeted at the particular issue (e.g., testing for illegal combinations of values might be\cbend\ too complex). \cbstart In this case, development (or re-development) to a suitable \index{Assurance Level!Software}\gls{software assurance level} of the complete set of software within the system should be considered\cbend\
\end{description}

\cbstart The issue with software affecting data\cbend\ is that the software may affect (e.g., corrupt, delete) the data in a way that key \index{Property!Safety}safety properties may be lost and\cbstart that such\cbend\ loss may not be easily detected. In general the key \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property} should be considered to see if any important ones for this data may be jeopardised. If so, a \index{Assurance Level!Software}\gls{software assurance level} from an appropriate standard or guideline should be introduced that mitigates this risk of undetected property loss. This \index{Assurance Level!Software}\gls{software assurance level} should be determined by the hazards that could be caused, and may be localised to the software that can cause the problem.

However there are specific functional and architectural approaches that may reduce or avoid the need for a \index{Assurance Level!Software}\gls{software assurance level}, including use of strong checksums and digital signatures, as well as techniques such as storing multiple copies, independent channels and so on. \cbstart The\cbend\ software performing the check of the \index{Property!Data}\gls{data property} will itself need to be developed to the introduced \index{Assurance Level!Software}\gls{software assurance level}. The key is to establish what the software in the system is doing to the data: if the operations are simple and non-changing, then the risk is lower; if the operations are complex involving transforming the data, using the data to calculate and insert new values, or reformatting the data, then the risk is higher.

\cbstart The effectiveness of the functional \glspl{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} in reducing impact to the particular \index{Property!Data}data properties needs to be determined. For example, a strong checksum may be very effective at detecting unwanted change and therefore lower the \index{Assurance Level!Software}\gls{software assurance level} (from the perspective of data-related requirements). However, a checksum may not help at all if the issue is one of timely message delivery. More \gls{information} on the use of checksums in the aviation domain is available in \cite{citation:koopman2015selection}; this \gls{information} is likely to be applicable to other domains as well\cbend.

\subsection{Evaluate and \glsfmttext{treat} Risks}
\label{bkm:EvaluateAndTreat}
\subsubsection{Risk \index{Treatment!Risk}\Glsfmttext{treatment}}
There is a range of approaches that could be used to \gls{treat} data-related risks. One option might be to redesign part of a system, either to remove the risk or to incorporate safety devices. Alternatively, ways of mitigating (or, more generally, treating) the risk could be devised. Another option could be to conduct further analysis, for example to better understand the likelihood of a risk occurring. In extreme cases, risk evaluation may lead to a recommendation to cancel a project.

It is apparent that some of these approaches involve repeating activities (or part of activities) discussed in earlier sections of this document. This type of repetition is to be expected given the iterative nature of risk management.

Discussion is an important part of risk evaluation, allowing a variety of different perspectives to be brought to bear. Documentation is also important, partly to allow these discussions to occur on an even footing and partly to ensure that decisions and supporting rationale are recorded.

\subsubsection{Mitigating Data Safety Risks}\index{Mitigation|textbf}
A range of methods and approaches can be used to mitigate the identified data safety risks. Since \gls{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} can be a complex process, requiring collaboration with all system engineering elements, a collection of high-level \gls{mitigation} measures is provided. These may particularly assist those attempting to explain the process to non-practitioners or those conducting assessments in less regulated environments. \cbstart These high-level \gls{mitigation} measures may prove sufficient for practitioners assessing systems which do not have a high safety criticality\cbend.

For practitioners conducting assessments in highly regulated environments, or for highly safety-critical systems, \cbstart appropriate\cbend\ \gls{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} measures should be derived from the high-level table. To assist these practitioners, suggested methods and approaches are provided in a series of more detailed tables. These methods and approaches have been developed through cross-industry collaboration, but they may not be complete, especially for different types of system. 

The practitioner should always consider whether the \gls{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} measures used to mitigate the data safety risks are sufficient for their purposes. In highly safety-critical systems, each data safety risk can be linked to a system-level \cbstart hazard\cbend. Each hazard \cbstart\ should be\cbend\ tracked in accordance with the existing system safety method, and \glspl{mitigation} \cbstart\ should be reviewed for their feasibility, potential to introduce new or amended hazards, and effectiveness\cbend.

\paragraph{High-level \glsfmttext{mitigation} measures}
\autoref{tab:HighLevelMitigations} presents a number of generally applicable \gls{mitigation} measures.
Each of these \gls{mitigation} measures should be reviewed to establish whether it is relevant to the system under assessment.

For each \index{Assurance Level!Data}\gls{dsal}, the tables indicate whether the method / approach is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Highly recommended (HR);
  \item Recommended (R); or
  \item \cbstart Neither recommended nor not recommended\cbend\ (-).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Detailed methods and approaches}
\label{bkm:DetailedMethods}
The following tables detail methods and approaches which may be used by practitioners conducting \index{Safety Assessment}safety assessments. The tables map the methods and approaches to data categories. \cbstart\ These data categories are abbreviated using the scheme shown in
\autoref{tab:DataCategoryAbbreviations}\cbend.

\cbstart The\cbend\ five data categories\index{Category!Data} presented in \autoref{tab:DataCategoryAbbreviations} are a subset of those presented in \autoref{tab:CategoriesShort}, which presents a comprehensive list of data categories\index{Category!Data}. The five presented in \autoref{tab:DataCategoryAbbreviations} have been used to populate the tables \cbstart\ used\cbend\ for the selection of methods and approaches. \cbstart Users of the guidance are also encouraged to add to this table as part of the customisation process associated with their own organizations or projects\cbend.

\begin{longtable}{|L{\dsiwgColumnWidth{0.2}}|C{\dsiwgColumnWidth{0.2}}|}

\end{longtable}

The tables also map the methods and approaches to the \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property}. \cbstart The\cbend\ properties
which were defined in \autoref{tab:PropertiesOfData} have been assigned abbreviations\cbstart, shown in that table.\cbend

\cbstart These\cbend\ detailed methods and approaches tables have been organized into eight, loosely-defined categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item System design\index{Category!Approach!System Design};
  \item Data design\index{Category!Approach!Data Design};
  \item Data implementation\index{Category!Approach!Data Implementation};
  \item Data migration\index{Category!Approach!Data Migration};
  \item Data testing\index{Category!Approach!Data Testing};
  \item Test data\index{Category!Approach!Test};
  \item Media -- paper\index{Category!Approach!Media -- Paper}; and 
  \item Media -- electronic\index{Category!Approach!Media -- Electronic}.
\end{itemize}

The method for using these tables when considering any given \index{Artefact, Data}\gls{data artefact}, is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} applicable to the \index{Artefact, Data}\cbstart\gls{data artefact}\cbend, using \autoref{tab:DSAL-risk-matrix} in association with \autoref{tab:Likelihood} and \autoref{tab:Severity}.
    \item Determine the data category\index{Category!Data}, using the abbreviations in \autoref{tab:DataCategoryAbbreviations}.
    \item Determine the list of applicable \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property}, using the abbreviations in \autoref{tab:PropertiesOfData}. This will generally provide a list of several applicable abbreviations.
\end{itemize}

Then consider each row in each table (or each table that you wish to use for this assessment). For each row, if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the data category\index{Category!Data} matches the data category\index{Category!Data} for this \index{Artefact, Data}\cbstart\gls{data artefact}\cbend; and
    \item at least one of the \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property} listed in that row matches a \index{Property!Data}\gls{data property} for the \cbstart\gls{data artefact}\cbend 
\end{itemize}
then the row is likely to be applicable to the \index{Artefact, Data}\cbstart\gls{data artefact}\cbend. The result for that row is therefore found from the \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} column, since if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The relevant \gls{dsal} entry is ``HR'', then use of the technique on this row is highly recommended.
    \item The relevant \gls{dsal} entry is ``R'', then use of the technique is recommended.
    \item The relevant \gls{dsal} entry is ``-'', then the technique should be considered, as it may be relevant in certain application domains, but \cbstart generic guidance would not be appropriate for specific contexts\cbend.
\end{itemize}

To give a specific example, consider the row corresponding to the first technique in \autoref{tab:MethodsSystemDesign}. This technique will apply to \index{Artefact, Data}\glspl{data artefact} where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The data category\index{Dynamic Data} is ``dynamic'' (``D'' from \autoref{tab:DataCategoryAbbreviations}) and
    \item The \index{Artefact, Data}\gls{data artefact} holds one or more of the \index{Integrity Property}properties \index{Integrity Property}\gls{integrity}, \index{Completeness!Property}\gls{completeness} or \gls{verifiability}\index{Verifiability Property} (``I'', ``C'' or ``V'' from \autoref{tab:PropertiesOfData}).
\end{itemize}
In such a case, the technique would be highly recommended if the \index{Artefact, Data}\gls{data artefact} were of \gls{dsal}\index{Assurance Level!Data} 3 or 4, recommended if the \gls{dsal} were 2, or should merely be considered if the \gls{dsal} were 1.

Many dots have been placed in the table to indicate data categories\index{Category!Data} and \index{Property!Data}data properties which are not applicable to the technique under consideration. The dots enable the tables to be assessed very quickly, as they enable the letters representing specific Data categories\index{Category!Data} and \index{Property!Data}\glspl{data property} to always be presented in the same position within the table. For example, the \index{Property!Data}\gls{data property} ``\gls{verifiability}''\index{Verifiability Property} (``V'' from \autoref{tab:PropertiesOfData} can easily be seen to appear against the first two techniques of \autoref{tab:MethodsSystemDesign}, whereas it does not appear in the next seven techniques. This can be seen without actually reading the text, but merely looking at the pattern presented by the letters and dots. 

Within each table, the ``Serial'' column lists a unique serial number for each technique. The serial numbers simply provide a unique reference which aligns with those implemented within the toolset.

\paragraph{Data \glsfmttext{verification}}
\label{bkm:dataVerification}
A number of issues need to be considered during the implementation phase of a programme, to ensure that at any point in the programme we know how much we can rely upon the data. \autoref{tab:MethodsDataProcedures} addresses those \glspl{mitigation}\index{Mitigation} relevant to this whole programme phase, not just from data capture or generation. It therefore includes aspects of data management, checking and expiry.

\paragraph{Recording the data safety risk \glsfmttext{mitigation}}\index{Mitigation}
The \gls{dsmp} can be used to document:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the tables of \gls{mitigation} measures (or methods and approaches) used for the system, context, and planned implementation under assessment;
  \item any specific \gls{mitigation} measures identified for the system and their source / justification;
  \item planned compliance with the tables; and
  \item confirmation that the \gls{mitigation} measures are sufficiently complete and consistent.
\end{itemize}  
The overall safety justification for the given \cbstart project, service, or operational context must then provide evidence of compliance with\cbend\ the plan.
