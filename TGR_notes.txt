1. Makefile created.
2. Longtable styles removed
3. mainByTim.bib removed
4. Front and back covers renamed to remove document version number (evident from the directory it's in anyway) so make can automatically update document when it changes.
5. Claimed a credit for myself in the frontmatter for helping with the editing.
6. Haven't worked out a way to include entries in both the normative and discursive glossaries. That could lead to confusion anyway - "Data Artefact" is normative but "(data) Artefact" is discursive. A reader who found the latter might not notice it's normative. I suggest adding a note at  the start of the discursive glossary similar to the one at the start of the normative glossary, and only including discursive definitions. In the e-version the hyperlinks will take readers to the right place.
7. Accuracy (temporal) only appears in the glossary (out of alphabetic order) so I've removed it.
8. In the frontmatter, should we still refer to the SAIWG as "the latest addition"?

TODO
need consistent citing of ISO standard numbers
