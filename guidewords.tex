\section{\glsfmtshort{hazop} Guidewords -- Detail (Informative)} \label{bkm:guidewords}

\dsiwgSectionQuote{I don't see the logic of rejecting data just because they seem incredible.}{Fred Hoyle}

\autoref{tab:HazopFull}
expands upon the \gls{hazop} guidewords presented in \autoref{tab:HazopShort} by adding Data Considerations which may be helpful in determining how to apply the guidewords to a specific instance of a \index{Property!Data}Property.
